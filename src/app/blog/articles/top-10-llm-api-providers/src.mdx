### Which LLM API Provider Is the Best?

It depends on your needs. Want speed? Try Groq or Fireworks AI. Real-time data? Go with Perplexity. Specialized models? Mistral. Community-driven experimentation? Hugging Face.

### How Do I Choose the Right LLM Provider?

Match your use case with the platform’s strengths: GPU pricing, model access, internet connection, or multi-provider routing.

### Can I Switch Between Providers Easily?

Yes. Most APIs follow similar formats. OpenRouter makes switching seamless by acting as a proxy layer.

### What About Pricing and Hidden Costs?

Read pricing docs carefully. Watch for fees on deposits (OpenRouter), storage (Databricks), or GPU usage (Hyperbolic).

### How to get AI observability when using LLM API providers?

Use [Keywords AI](https://docs.keywordsai.co/integration/own-api-keys), a full-stack platform that supports observability and logging for all the major LLM providers.
