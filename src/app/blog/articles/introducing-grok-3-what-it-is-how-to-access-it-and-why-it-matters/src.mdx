**Grok 3** is the latest flagship AI model from Elon Musk’s xAI, touted as the company’s smartest and most powerful AI assistant to date. It represents a major leap in reasoning ability and scale, blending superior logical “thinking” with a vast base of knowledge. Building on its predecessors (Grok-1 and Grok-2), Grok 3 has been trained on xAI’s colossal 200,000-GPU _Colossus_ supercomputer, giving it **10× more computing power** than the previous generation. The result is an AI that excels at complex problem-solving in math, coding, and general knowledge, often _articulating step-by-step reasoning_ rather than just spitting out answers.

In this blog post, we’ll explore what Grok 3 can do, how you can try it out, the technical details behind it, its best use cases, and how it improves upon earlier versions.

### 1. General Overview – What Grok 3 Is and What It Can Do

Grok 3 is **xAI’s third-generation large language model (LLM) and AI chatbot**, representing a significant advancement in AI capabilities. It’s designed not just to generate text, but to serve as an intelligent assistant that can reason through problems in a human-like way.

Key characteristics of Grok 3 include:

- **Advanced Reasoning:** Grok 3 can “think” through multi-step problems by internally simulating a [chain-of-thought](https://www.keywordsai.co/blog/lets-think-step-by-step-chain-of-thought-prompting-in-llms). It was trained with reinforcement learning to refine this reasoning process, allowing it to take time (seconds to even minutes) to analyze complex queries, backtrack on mistakes, and produce more accurate answers.
- **Extensive Knowledge Base:** Thanks to an expansive pre-training dataset and a massive compute budget (10× the compute of previous models), Grok 3 has a strong grasp of world knowledge, programming, science, and more. It has achieved leading scores on academic benchmarks and even topped a chatbot arena leaderboard with an Elo score over 1400.
- **Enhanced Skills (Coding, Math, etc.):** Grok 3 demonstrated outstanding performance on competitive math exams (scoring ~93% on a recent AIME test) and coding benchmarks. It can act as a capable coding assistant (writing or fixing code) and handle complex calculations or logical puzzles much better than earlier versions.
- **Multi-Modal and “Agentic” Abilities:** Beyond text, Grok 3 can work with visual inputs and external tools like a code interpreter and a real-time web search agent called DeepSearch.
