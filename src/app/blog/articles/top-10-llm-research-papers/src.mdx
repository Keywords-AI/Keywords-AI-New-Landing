In January 2024, we launched **Keywords AI**, initially as an LLM monitoring platform. To provide truly professional and credible support to our customers, I realized I needed to deepen my expertise in the rapidly evolving field of LLMs.

So, I set a simple but ambitious goal at the start of the year: **read at least one research paper every week**. What started as a personal commitment turned into a transformative journey—not only for me but for Keywords AI. The insights I gained helped us improve our LLM observability platform and even inspired us to evolve into a **full-stack LLM engineering platform**.

By the end of 2024, I had read **61 research papers** — all of which left me with new ideas and deeper insights. I’ve recorded these papers on my Notion page, and I’ll share the **full list at the end of this blog**.

In this first part, I want to spotlight the **Top 10 LLM research papers** I read in 2024. These papers stood out for their impact, creativity, or relevance, and I’ll summarize why each one is worth your time. Let’s dive in!
