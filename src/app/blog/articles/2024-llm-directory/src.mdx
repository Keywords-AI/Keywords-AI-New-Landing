## The 2024 LLM Directory: Find the Best Models for Your Use Cases

With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, new language models are emerging every week, each offering unique strengths and capabilities. Navigating this ever-evolving landscape can be challenging, especially when identifying the best large language model (LLM) for specific use cases.

In this blog, we will explore the top 5 LLMs for 5 different fields. After spending a weekend testing over 100 LLMs and considering our users' preferences and use cases, along with data from Huggingface, we have compiled a comprehensive guide to help you choose the right LLM for your needs.

### Coding

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** Anthropic’s latest flagship model, leading [the LMSYS Arena Leaderboard’s Coding category](https://chat.lmsys.org/). It surpasses every existing LLMs, becoming our team's primary coding assistant, replacing GPT-4o.  
- **GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09:** OpenAI's top choice for coding, solving most problems efficiently. Its drawback is the pricing, which is double that of GPT-4o.  
- **GPT-4o-2024-05-13:** OpenAI's flagship model, though slightly less proficient in coding than GPT-4-Turbo. It solves most daily coding issues but tends to repeat code. However, its speed makes it ideal for AI coding assistants.  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** Google's latest, highly capable model for coding. Comparable to GPT-4o in performance, its limited public availability restricts high-volume usage.  
- **Claude 3 Opus:** Anthropic’s previous flagship model is on par with GPT-4-Turbo in performance but is currently too expensive to recommend. ($15 / 1M input tokens, $75 / 1M output tokens)

- **Llama 3 70b Instruct:** Meta’s open-source LLM, Llama-3–70b, is currently the best open-source LLM available. It is known for its thorough outlines, ability to learn from reference texts, and high-quality text generation. Llama-3–70b’s nuanced responses and attention to detail make it stand out among competitors. **Best for: blog writing, detailed articles, and technical documentation.**  
- **GPT-4o-2024-05-13:** OpenAI's most powerful LLM for content creation. It generates high-quality content and understands prompts clearly. It shines particularly when integrated with ChatGPT, allowing users to utilize a wide range of tools for enhanced functionality. **Best for: versatile content creation and email writing.**  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** A top contender from Google, Gemini 1.5 Pro performed exceptionally well in script writing, matching the capabilities of Llama-3–70b and Claude-3-Sonnet. Its nuanced responses and attention to detail make it a strong choice for content creation tasks. **Best for: comprehensive reports, story development, and academic writing.**  
- **Mistral Large:** Another strong performer in the content creation field, Mistral Large offers robust capabilities in generating quality content. Though not as widely recognized as some competitors, it produces coherent, detailed text. **Best for: general content creation, marketing copy, and social media posts.**

### Translation

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** This model is widely used by many AI language translators due to its excellent performance across most languages and cost-effectiveness. **Best for: Spanish, German, and general multilingual translations.**  
- **GPT-4o-2024-05-13:** OpenAI's powerful model supports multiple languages and excels particularly in translating Chinese, French, German, and Spanish. **Best for: Chinese, French, German, and Spanish translations, especially where speed and accuracy are crucial.**  
- **Gemini Pro:** Known for its strong performance in French translations, Gemini Pro is also a reliable choice for other languages. **Best for: French translations and versatile multilingual tasks.**  
- **Llama 3 70b Instruct:** Meta’s open-source LLM supports multiple languages, with notable proficiency in Spanish. **Best for: Spanish translations and open-source multilingual projects.**  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** This model excels in translating Chinese, French, and German, making it a top choice for these languages. **Best for: Chinese, French, and German translations, particularly in professional and technical contexts.**

### Long Text Summarization

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** With a large context window of 200K, this model matches the performance of Opus but at a quarter of the cost. Its max output token limit is 4096 tokens. **Best for: summarizing extensive documents and articles where cost-effectiveness is important.**  
- **GPT-4o-2024-05-13:** Featuring a 100K context window, GPT-4o is exceptionally fast and consistently accurate, rarely hallucinating. **Best for: reliable and speedy summarization of lengthy texts with minimal errors.**  
- **Command R+:** The top choice for local deployment, Command R+ excels at structuring and organizing summaries. It effectively splits layers of abstraction and formats topics coherently. **Best for: local summarization tasks requiring detailed and well-structured outputs.**  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** With a 100K context length and incredible speed, Gemini 1.5 Pro can summarize thousands of pages within a minute. **Best for: rapid summarization of very large documents, such as multi-thousand-page PDFs.**  
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash:** Google’s cost-effective and extremely fast model, though not as reliable as Gemini 1.5 Pro. **Best for: quick summarization tasks where cost and speed are prioritized over reliability.**

### Document Processing

- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet:** This model excels in extracting detailed information from complex documents, handling intricate data with impressive precision. Its performance in processing financial data and other detailed documents stands out. **Best for: detailed financial data extraction, complex document analysis, and precise information retrieval.**  
- **GPT-4o-2024-05-13:** GPT-4o is a robust model for document processing, offering a wide range of capabilities.
