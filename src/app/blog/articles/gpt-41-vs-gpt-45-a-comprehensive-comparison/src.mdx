## GPT-4.1 vs GPT-4.5: A comprehensive comparison

OpenAI’s GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.5 are two advanced versions of the GPT-4 model, each with unique strengths. This post provides an accessible comparison of the two, covering their technical differences, performance in key tasks (coding, content writing, chat), and practical guidance on choosing between them.

|| **GPT-4.1** | **GPT-4.5** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Context Window** | 1,000,000 tokens | 128,000 tokens |
| **Knowledge Cutoff** | June 2024 | September 2023 |
| **Pricing (Input)** | $2.00 per 1M tokens | $75 per 1M tokens |
| **Pricing (Output)** | $8.00 per 1M tokens | $150 per 1M tokens |
| **Strengths** | Coding, large-context tasks, cost-efficiency | Conversational depth, creative content |
| **Considerations** | API-only, less conversational nuance | High cost, slower response |

### Technical Overview

[GPT-4.5](https://www.keywordsai.co/llm-library/gpt-4.5-preview) is OpenAI’s largest model yet, with ~12.8 trillion parameters and a context window of 128,000 tokens. It excels in nuanced, emotionally intelligent responses, but at high cost and diminishing returns in some tasks. 

[GPT-4.1](https://www.keywordsai.co/llm-library/gpt-4.1) focuses on efficiency and practical improvements, including superior coding performance, strict instruction-following, and an unprecedented context window of up to 1 million tokens. It’s cost-effective and has a more recent knowledge base (mid-2024 vs. GPT-4.5’s 2023).

### Content Creation and Writing

**GPT-4.5** shines in creative and conversational writing, ideal for blogs, marketing materials, and social media. It delivers rich, nuanced content. 

**GPT-4.1** excels in tasks requiring strict adherence to guidelines or formats. It reliably produces clear, accurate content and can handle extensive background material thanks to its large context window. Choose GPT-4.5 for creativity; GPT-4.1 for structured, cost-sensitive projects.

### Chat Experience (Conversational Intelligence)

**GPT-4.5** sets the standard in conversational AI, offering natural, engaging interactions with emotional nuance. Ideal for customer service and interactive applications. 

**GPT-4.1** provides reliable, precise responses but is more straightforward. It offers faster response times and is suited for task-oriented conversations or real-time applications.

### Reasoning Ability and Factual Accuracy

Both models offer strong reasoning and factual accuracy. GPT-4.5 excels at general knowledge and conversational reasoning but occasionally experiences diminishing returns on complex logic. 

GPT-4.1’s advantage is handling extensive contexts, making it ideal for analyzing large documents or cross-referencing complex data. It strictly follows instructions and reduces factual hallucinations by clearly stating uncertainty. For deep, context-driven reasoning tasks, GPT-4.1 is superior.

### Choosing Between GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.5 

- Coding & Structured Tasks: GPT-4.1  
- Creative Writing & Conversation: GPT-4.5  
- Budget-Conscious or High-Volume Usage: GPT-4.1  
- Conversational Quality & Premium Tasks: GPT-4.5  

**Bottom Line:** Use GPT-4.1 for efficiency, extensive context, coding, and cost-sensitive tasks. Choose GPT-4.5 for superior conversational quality, creativity, and nuanced interactions.
