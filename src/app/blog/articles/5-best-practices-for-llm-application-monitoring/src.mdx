## 5 Best Practices for LLM Application Monitoring

LLM apps need careful watching. Here's how to do it right:  
- **Track key metrics**: Accuracy, latency, cost, user engagement  
- **Set up alerts**: Choose metrics, set thresholds, plan actions  
- **Check data quality**: Define standards, use tools, monitor over time  
- **Test for security**: Use [OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) Top 10, control access, watch logs  
- **Pick an LLM monitoring platform**: [Keywords AI](https://www.keywordsai.co/), Langsmith

### Why it matters:
- Keeps AI apps reliable and safe  
- Catches mistakes and biases  
- Saves money on resources  
- Protects user data

> Remember: LLM monitoring is ongoing. Keep learning and improving your process.

### 1. Track Key Metrics

Keeping your LLM app running smoothly? It's all about watching the right numbers. Here's what you need to track:  

**Accuracy**: Is your LLM getting it right? This is key for quality.  

**Latency**: Speed counts. Watch these:  
- Time to First Token (TTFT)  
- Time Per Output Token (TPOT)  

**Cost**: LLM requests can hit your wallet hard. Some might set you back $1–5 each.  

**User Engagement**: Are folks actually using your LLM?

### 2. Set Up Alert Systems

Alert systems are crucial for your LLM app. They help you catch issues fast and get user feedback.  

Here's how to set up effective alerts:  

- **Pick your metrics**  
Choose what to track based on your app's goals. This might include accuracy, latency, or user engagement.  

- **Set thresholds**  
Decide when an alert should trigger. For example:

- **Choose alert channels**  
Pick how you'll get notified. Options include Slack, email, SMS, or [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/).  

- **Create an action plan**  
Know what to do when an alert fires. This might mean checking data quality, adjusting model parameters, or pausing the service for fixes.  

- **Gather user feedback**  
Set up ways for users to report issues or give input. This could be through in-app feedback forms, user surveys, or support ticket analysis.  

- **Use anomaly detection**  
Spot weird patterns that might signal problems. Tools like [Edge Delta](https://edgedelta.com/use-cases/anomaly-detection) can help with this.  

- **Test your system**  
Make sure alerts work as planned. Run drills to check response times and processes.  

Keep improving your alert system. What you track today might not be what you need tomorrow.

### 3. Check Data Quality

Data quality can make or break your LLM app. Bad data? Bad results. Simple as that.  

Here's how to keep your data clean:  

**Set quality standards**  
What's “good data” for your app? Define it. Example:

**Use LLM evaluation framework**  
Frameworks like Relari and Ragas can run evaluations on your LLM responses and your RAG content. You can self host those frameworks or choose a provider to automatically log your LLM requests and run the evaluations, like Keywords AI.  

**Monitor key metrics**  
Track data quality over time. Watch for drops.  

**Export good data to a dataset**  
Simply export those good data to a dataset — you could feed your LLM with those golden datasets.

### 4. Test for Security Flaws

LLM apps can be a hacker's playground. You need to test for security issues regularly.  

Here's how:

**Use the OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**  
OWASP lists the top 10 security risks for LLM apps:

### 5. Pick a Unified LLMOps Platform

You need specialized tools to keep your LLM apps running smoothly. Here are some top options:
