## Beyond Datadog: Why LLM developers are switching to Keywords AI

### Introduction

<span className="text-md-regular" style={{ color: "#6483F0" }}>Datadog</span> is a cloud monitoring platform that provides:  
- Infrastructure monitoring  
- Application performance tracking  
- Log management  
- Security monitoring  
- LLM monitoring  

It integrates with numerous technologies, offering a unified view of metrics, traces, and logs. Datadog is useful for complex, distributed systems and cloud-based architectures, helping teams quickly identify issues and optimize performance.

### LLM observability platform choice

As AI and LLMs gain prominence, Datadog has expanded its services to include LLM monitoring for companies integrating these technologies into their workflows or core features. While Datadog excels in infrastructure monitoring, users often cite high costs and platform complexity as drawbacks.

Consequently, many LLM developers are turning to Keywords AI instead of Datadog for several reasons:  
- Incredible shipping speed  
- Best UI/UX  
- Comprehensive LLM observability and debugging tools  
- Built for LLM developers  
- Competitive pricing  
- 24/7 Founder support

### Features in Keywords AI that you canâ€™t ignore

**LLM playground**

Keywords AI offers a powerful LLM playground used by thousands of developers to test prompts, debug suboptimal LLM outputs, and experiment with various LLMs. Developers can import their LLM logs to the playground and refine their prompts for optimal results. In our LLM playground, developers can:  
- Test prompts with over 200 LLMs  
- Import LLM logs to the playground with a single click  
- Use compare mode to evaluate two LLMs simultaneously  
- Add and test function calling directly in the frontend

**Prompt management**

Prompts are the cornerstone of any LLM application, with output quality heavily dependent on prompt effectiveness. Creating clear, accurate, and detailed prompts is crucial for building a great product.

Keywords AI's prompt management system enables teams to:  
- Create, iterate, and version prompts collaboratively  
- Deploy the latest prompts to production with a single click  
- Test prompts in our comprehensive LLM playground

**Reliability Settings**

While many tools enable rapid AI app development, reliability is often overlooked. High error rates can significantly impact user retention and satisfaction. Keywords AI's reliability settings help make your AI apps more robust.

Developers can:  
- [Increase LLM rate limits at no additional cost](https://www.keywordsai.co/blog/increase-llm-rate-limits)  
- [Subscribe to alerts](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/monitoring/subscribe-alerts) for immediate error notifications  
- [Set up fallbacks using backup models](https://docs.keywordsai.co/features/generation/fallbacks) to mitigate upstream provider errors

### Conclusion

While Datadog offers comprehensive infrastructure monitoring, Keywords AI emerges as a specialized solution for LLM developers. With its user-friendly interface, rapid integration, and focused features like the LLM playground, prompt management, and reliability settings, Keywords AI addresses the unique challenges of LLM development.  

As AI continues to evolve, tools like Keywords AI provide the necessary observability and debugging capabilities to help developers create more robust and efficient LLM applications. By choosing a platform tailored to LLM development, teams can streamline their workflows, improve productivity, and ultimately deliver better AI-powered products to their users.
