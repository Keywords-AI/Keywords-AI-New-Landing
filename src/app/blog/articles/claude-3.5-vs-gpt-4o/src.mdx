## Claude-3.5-Sonnet vs. GPT-4o: which is better?

### TL;DR

- We compared Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4o across various AI tasks.  
- Claude-3.5-Sonnet excels in context precision, faithfulness, and readability.  
- GPT-4o is faster and better for voice AI startups due to lower latency and quicker time to first token (TTFT).  
- I'll show you how to test and compare these models in just 1 minute using [Keywords AI](https://keywordsai.co).

### Intro

Anthropic released its latest flagship LLM Claude-3.5-Sonnet on Jun 20, 2024. It’s 2x faster than Claude-3-Sonnet at 20% of the cost and better performance in every mainstream LLM benchmark.  

OpenAI released its most intelligent model, GPT-4o, on May 13, 2024. It’s 2x faster and 50% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo.
