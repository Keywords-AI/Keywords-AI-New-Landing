### What is OpenAI Deep Research?

OpenAI Deep Research is an AI-powered agent integrated into ChatGPT, designed to conduct in-depth, multi-step research on the internet. Unlike a standard ChatGPT session that gives quick answers, Deep Research works like an autonomous researcher: you give it a prompt, and it will independently search, analyze, and synthesize information from hundreds of sources to produce a comprehensive answer. It leverages OpenAI’s advanced “o3” model and other tools to dig deeper and compile findings into structured outputs. Essentially, it's as if you had a tireless virtual research assistant with a PhD, capable of doing hours of work in minutes.

**Key capabilities of Deep Research include:**

- **Multi-step analysis:** It can break down complex questions into sub-tasks, perform multiple web searches and document reads, then aggregate the findings into one cohesive report.  
- **Interactive questioning:** Deep Research often asks you clarifying questions at the start to refine its understanding of your request.  
- **Structured reports:** The output is typically a well-organized report with clear sections, headings, and bullet points for readability.  
- **Source citations:** Every claim or data point it provides is backed by a citation linking to the source.  
- **Diverse input handling:** You can feed Deep Research various types of inputs to inform the query—web URLs, PDFs, even images or spreadsheets.  
- **Niche information discovery:** The agent excels at digging up **non-obvious, niche information** that would normally require combing through many specialized sources.
