  "introduction": "We just shipped bar charts to the Dashboard on Keywords AI (YC W24)! \n\n Why bar charts? \n\n Line graphs are great for trends, but when you're working with discrete time buckets — like hourly traffic or error counts — bar charts are much easier to read. You can quickly spot spikes, compare values, and get a clear sense of what's happening. \n\n Some common use cases: \n- See traffic by hour more clearly \n- Catch error spikes at a glance \n- Understand how prompt and completion tokens change over time \n\n You can turn it on in: \n\n Settings → Preferences → Show bar chart",
